% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else

% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
% Do NOT use the amsbsy package under comsoc mode as that feature is
% already built into the Times Math font (newtxmath, mathtime, etc.).
% 
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath


% Select a Times math font under comsoc mode or else one will automatically
% be selected for you at the document start. This is required as Communications
% Society journals use a Times, not Computer Modern, math font.
\usepackage[cmintegrals]{newtxmath}
% The freely available newtxmath package was written by Michael Sharpe and
% provides a feature rich Times math font. The cmintegrals option, which is
% the default under IEEEtran, is needed to get the correct style integral
% symbols used in Communications Society journals. Version 1.451, July 28,
% 2015 or later is recommended. Also, do *not* load the newtxtext.sty package
% as doing so would alter the main text font.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/newtx
%
% Alternatively, you can use the MathTime commercial fonts if you have them
% installed on your system:
%\usepackage{mtpro2}
%\usepackage{mt11p}
%\usepackage{mathtime}


%\usepackage{bm}
% The bm.sty package was written by David Carlisle and Frank Mittelbach.
% This package provides a \bm{} to produce bold math symbols.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/bm





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:

% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.

\begin{abstract}
Robotic kinematic describes the nonlinear relationship between the joint space and task space. Solving the inverse kinematics problem is finding the joints variables that corresponds to the task space positions. Usually, it's hard to solve the inverse kinematics for a multi degree of freedom robot system since it's a nonlinear problem with multiple variables as well as constraints from both the joint limits and task specifications. Considered about the complexity of this problem, the nonlinear optimization algorithm becomes a perfect choice in general cases.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{I}{nverse} kinematics is one of the fundamental problems in robotics research which objective is to find a robot configuration that leads the robot end effector to desired position and orientation within the limits of the robot manipulator.In other words, inverse kinematics transfers the end effector task space coordinates into joint space coordinates. The position and orientation of the end effector are nonlinearly related to the joint variables which number is the DOF of the robot. \\

In three-dimensional space, a manipulator with six or more DOF is able to attain any end effector position and  orientation. If the manipulator has six DOF, the system with six nonlinear equations can be solved for six joint variables. However, if the robot manipulator has more than six DOF, it is underdetermined since it has more variable than equations[3]. The inverse kinematics problem can be treated as a root finding problem of multi-variables nonlinear polynomial equations. Unfortunately, it is hard to find the analytical solution. \\

Numerical methods like the Newton-Raphsom(NR) method can be used to solve inverse kinematics problem. The NR method can find solutions if and only if the Jacobian matrix is always reversible and the equations are solvable. The former condition means that the robot should be nonredundant, namely, the number of variables should be the same as the number of equations and constraints, and the robot will not pass through the singular points during moving from the initial configuration to the final configuration[2]. The latter one means the destination position and orientation for the end effector should within the workspace of the robot manipulator. \\ 

Usually, the inverse kinematics problem should be considered under the task for robot manipulator. The specification of the robot task will introduce addtional constraints for this problem which make  it much more complex. Nonlinear optimization algorithms become a good choice for solving inverse kinematics. \\

The organization of this report is as follows: The kinematics problem is introduced in Section II. Section III presents the formulation of eight DOF inverse kinematics problem for grasping objects. Section IV shows the principles of SQP algorithm. Simulation result and discussions are  in Section V.  

% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)



\section{ROBOT KINEMATICS}
Kinematics treats motion of robot manipulator without considering the forces cause it[4]. Within kinematics, the relationship between position, velocity, acceleration and all higher order derivatives of the position variables can be studied. In other words, kinematics of robot manipulators refers to all the geometrical and time-based properties of the motion. \\

Inverse kinematics is given a desired position in the world frame solving for the joint variables . Since the relationship between joint variables and the position if nonlinear and the number of variables is more then the equations in the relationship, it's impossible to solve the inverse kinematics problem directly. \\

In kinematics, the transformation matrix $\Tb$ is necessary, 
\[
\begin{split}
\Tb &= 
  \left[
  \begin{matrix}
  \Rb & \db \\
  \mbox{\boldmath $0$}& 1 
  \end{matrix}  
  \right] \\
  &=
  \left[
  \begin{matrix}
  r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & d_1 \\
  r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & d_2 \\
  r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & d_3 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 
  \end{matrix} 
  \right] 
  \end{split} \tag{1}
\] 
in which $\Rb$ is the rotation matrix and $\db$ is the transition vector. Elements in $\Rb$ and $\db$ are decided by the joint variables of the robot manipulator. Let $\Theta = (\theta_1, \theta_2, ..., \theta_n)$ be the joint variable vector. We can rewrite $\Rb$,$\db$ and $\Tb$ as $\Rb(\Theta)$,$\db(\Theta)$ and $\Tb(\Theta)$.  \\

Robot manipulator is multiple joints system.  To calculate the position of the end effector in the world frame, local frame system for joints should be created and each joint has one aligned local frame.
 The first frame is the world/base frame and $\Tb_i^{i+1}$ is the transformation matrix from the $i$th frame to $i+1$th frame.  Then we have 
\[
\pb_w = \Tb_0^1*\Tb_1^2*... *\Tb_{n-1}^n * \pb_e \tag{2}
\]
 in which $\pb_w$ is the position of one point in the world frame, $\pb_e$ is the position in the end effector's local frame and $n$ is the degree of freedom of the robot system.\\

Our robot system contains one four DOF robot arm and one four DOF robot hand. So the system's DOF is eight. The robot system and it's model with local frames are shown in Fig 1.

\end{figure}

 

\section{PROBLEM FORMULATION}
Inverse kinematics usually comes with  specific robot tasks.  So when we try to solve this problem, it is necessary to consider the task constraints. Moreover, robot has it's own workspace, which also can introduce limitations for the inverse kinematics problem. \\ 

Consider the grasping task for robot manipulator, which requires the robot's fingers reach desired positions on the surface of the object. This problem can be described as follows:
\begin{itemize} 
\item All the joint variables should be within the limits of the robot joints
\item The target points should be located on the lower links of the robot fingers
\item The lower links should be parallel to the tangential plane of the target points
\end{itemize} 

The first characteristic means that the solution should be reasonable. If the joints variables are out of the boundary, the robot can't achieve such configuration and the solution is meaningless. The second property comes form the grasping experiment of human beings since we prefer to use the tip part of our hand rather than the plum to grasp objects. The third one regulate the grasping task by guaranteeing the fingers will not insert into the object. \\

The nonlinearity  together with multiple constraints make the inverse kinematics problem much more complex. We can convert it into a nonlinear optimization problem as follows: 
\[
\min \ \  \sum_{i=0}^{2} \frac{\|(\pb_i-\qb_{i1})\times (\pb_i-\qb_{i2}) \|}{\|\qb_i-\qb_{i2}\|}   \tag{3}
\]

Subject to 
\[
\nb_i \times \lb_{\perp i} =0 \tag{4}
\]
\[
\nb_i * \lb_{\perp i} \geq 0    \tag{5}

In the objective function which minimize the sum of distance from the target points to the lower links, $\pb_i$ is the $i$th target point, $\qb_{i1}$ is the top point of $i$th lower link and $\qb_{i2}$  is the tip of $i$th lower link. $\nb_i$ is the normal direction of the tangential plane of $i$th target point and $\lb_{\perp i}$ is the normal direction of the $i$th lower link.\\ Equation (4) guarantees the normal direction of the lower links parallel to the normal directions of the tangential planes which means the lower links parallel to the tangential planes. Inequality (5) shows that the angles between the normal directions of the lower links and  normal directions of tangential planes  are less than $\pi$. (4) and (5) together make sure that the normal vectors are in the same direction. \\


Equation (6) and (8) mean that $\pb_i$ is on the segment with two end points $\qb_{i1}$ and $\qb_{i2}$. For the inverse kinematics problem, it corresponding to the target points should be on the lower links of the robot hand. (7) gives the mechanical limits of the robot manipulator. In other words, it defines the workspace of the robot. \\

\section{Sequential Quadratic Programming}

In constrained optimization, the general aim is to transform the problem into an easier subproblem that can then be solved and used as the basis of an iterative process. A characteristic of a large class of early methods is the translation of the constrained problem to a basic unconstrained problem by using a penalty function for constraints that are near or beyond the constraint boundary. In this way the constrained problem is solved using a sequence of parameterized unconstrained optimizations, which in the limit (of the sequence) converge to the constrained problem. These methods are now considered relatively inefficient and have been replaced by methods that have focused on the solution of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) equations. The KKT equations are necessary conditions for optimality for a constrained optimization problem. If the problem is a so-called convex programming problem, that is, $f(x)$ and $g_i(x)$, $i = 1,\cdots,m$, are convex functions, then the KKT equations are both necessary and sufficient for a global solution point.

Give the general problem
\begin{equation}
    \min_{\xb \in \mathcal{R}^n} f(\xb) \label{gp}
\end{equation}
subject to
\begin{eqnarray*}
    g_i(\xb) & = & 0, \quad i = 1, \cdots , m\\
    h_i(\xb) & \leq & 0, \quad j = 1,\cdots , r
\end{eqnarray*}
The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions can be stated as
\begin{eqnarray}
  \nabla f(\xb^*) & + & \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i \cdot \nabla g_i(\xb^*) + \sum_{j=1}^r \mu_j \cdot \nabla h_j(\xb^*) =  0  \label{eq:kkt-gradient}\\
  g_j(\xb) & = & 0,  \quad i = 1, \cdots, m \nonumber\\
  \mu_i \cdot h_i(\xb) & = & 0, \quad i = 1, \cdots , r \nonumber\\
  h_i(x) & \leq & 0, \quad i = 1, \cdots, r \nonumber\\
  \mu_i &\geq & 0, \quad i = 1,\cdots, r\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

The equation (\ref{eq:kkt-gradient}) describes a canceling of the gradients between the objective function and the active constraints at the solution point. For the gradients to be canceled, Lagrange multipliers ($\lambda_i, i = 1,\cdots,m$) are necessary to balance the deviations in magnitude of the objective function and constraint gradients. Because only active constraints are included in this canceling operation, constraints that are not active must not be included in this operation and so are given Lagrange multipliers equal to 0. This is stated implicitly in the last two Kuhn-Tucker equations.

The solution of the KKT equations forms the basis to many nonlinear programming algorithms. These algorithms attempt to compute the Lagrange multipliers directly. Constrained quasi-Newton methods guarantee superlinear convergence by accumulating second-order information regarding the KKT equations using a quasi-Newton updating procedure. These methods are commonly referred to as Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) methods, since a QP subproblem is solved at each major iteration.

 Active Set method is one of the most successful SQP method. It allows us to closely mimic Newton's method for constrained optimization just as is done for unconstrained optimization. At each major iteration, an approximation is made of the Hessian of the Lagrangian function using a quasi-Newton updating method. This is then used to generate a QP subproblem whose solution is used to form a search direction for a line search procedure. The step length parameter is determined by a line search procedure such that a sufficient decreases can be obtained in a merit function. 
 
 The Active Set method consists of three main stage, which are discussed briefly in the following subsections.
 
 \subsection{Form Quadratic Subproblem}
 
 Given the problem description in general problem (\ref{gp}), the principal idea is the formulation of a QP subproblem based on a quadratic approximation of the Lagrangian function:
 
 \begin{equation}
     L(x, \lambda, \mu) = f(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i \cdot g_i(x) + \sum_{j=1}^r \mu_j \cdot  h_j(x) \label{lagrangian}
 \end{equation}
 By linearizing the nonlinear constraints, we obtain the QP subproblem
 \begin{equation}
  \min_{\db \in \mathcal{R}^n} {1 \over 2} \db^\top H_k \db + \nabla f(\xb_k)^\top \db
\end{equation}
subject to:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \nabla g_i(\xb_k)^\top \db + g_i(\xb_k) & = & 0 , \quad i = 1,\cdots , m \\
  \nabla h_j(\xb_k)^\top \db + h_j(\xb_k) & \leq & 0  , \quad j = 1,\cdots , r
\end{eqnarray*}
where the matrix $H_k$ is a positive definite approximation of the Hessian matrix of the Lagrangian function (Eq. \ref{lagrangian}). $H_k$ can be updated by any of the quasi-Newton methods, although the BFGS method appears to be the most popular.

\begin{eqnarray}
    C_k^{\rm BFGS} & = & {q_kq_k^\top \over q_k^T s_k} - {H_k p_k p_k^\top H_k^\top \over p_k^\top H_k p_k} \\
    H_{k+1} & = & H_{k} + C_k^{\rm BFGS}
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray*}
    p_k & = & x_{k+1} - x_k \\
    q_k & = & \Biggl(\nabla f(x_{k+1}) + \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i \cdot \nabla g_i(x_{k+1}) + \sum_{j=1}^r \mu_j \cdot \nabla h_j(x_{k+1})\Biggr) \\
    & & - \Biggl(\nabla f(x_{k}) + \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i \cdot \nabla g_i(x_{k}) + \sum_{j=1}^r \mu_j \cdot \nabla h_j(x_{k})\Biggr)
\end{eqnarray*}


\subsection{Quadratic Subproblem Solution}



 At each major iteration of the SQP method, a QP problem of the following form is solved, where $A_i$ refers to the $i$-th row of the $(m+r)$-by-$n$ matrix A.
\begin{eqnarray}
     \min_{\db \in \mathcal{R}^n} & = & \frac{1}{2} \db^\top H\db + \cb^\top \db, \label{subqp}\\
     A_i \db & = & b_i,\quad i = 1, \cdots, m, \nonumber \\
     A_i \db & \leq & b_i, \quad i = m+1, \cdots, m+r \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

 
This subproblem can be solved using any QP algorithm. The solution is used to form a new iterate
\begin{equation}
  \xb_{k+1} = \xb_k + \alpha_k \db_k
\end{equation}
 
 The solution procedure involves two phases. The first phase involves the calculation of a feasible point (if one exists). The second phase involves the generation of an iterative sequence of feasible points that converge to the solution. In this method an active set, $\bar{A}_k$, is maintained that is an estimate of the active constraints (i.e., those that are on the constraint boundaries) at the solution point. Virtually all QP algorithms are active set methods. This point is emphasized because there exist many different methods that are very similar in structure but that are described in widely different terms.
 
 $\bar{A}_k$ is updated at each iteration $k$, and this is used to form a basis for a search direction $\hat{\db}_k$. Equality constraints always remain in the active set $\bar{A}_k$. The notation for the variable $\hat{\db}_k$ is used here to distinguish it from $\db_k$ in the major iterations of the SQP method. The search direction $\hat{\db}_k$ is calculated and minimizes the objective function while remaining on any active constraint boundaries. The feasible subspace for $\hat{\db}_k$ is formed from a basis $Z_k$ whose columns are orthogonal to the estimate of the active set $\bar{A}_k$. Thus a search direction, which is formed from a linear summation of any combination of the columns of $Z_k$, is guaranteed to remain on the boundaries of the active constraints. 
 
 Once $Z_k$ is found, a new search direction $\hat{\db}_k$ is sought that minimizes $q(d)$ where $\hat{\db}_k$ is in the null space of the active constraints. That is, $\hat{\db}_k$ is a linear combination of the columns of $Z_k: \hat{\db}_k = Z_k \pb$ for some vector $\pb$.
 
 At each iteration, because of the quadratic nature of the objective function, there are only two choices of step length $\alpha$. A step of unity along $\hat{\db}_k$ is the exact step to the minimum of the function restricted to the null space of $A_k$. If such a step can be taken, without violation of the constraints, then this is the solution to QP (Eq. \ref{subqp}). Otherwise, the step along $\hat{\db}_k$ to the nearest constraint is less than unity and a new constraint is included in the active set at the next iteration. The distance to the constraint boundaries in any direction $\hat{\db}_k$ is given by
 \begin{equation*}
     \alpha = \min_{i \in \{1,\cdots, m+r\}} \Biggl\{ \frac{-A_ix_k + b_i}{A_i \hat{\db}_k} \Biggr\}
 \end{equation*}
which is defined for constraints not in the active set, and where the direction $\hat{\db}_k$ towards the constraint boundary.

When $n$ independent constraints are included in the active set, without location of the minimum, Lagrange multipliers, $\lambda_k$, are calculated that satisfy the nonsingular set of linear equations
\begin{equation*}
    A_k^\top \lambda_k = c.
\end{equation*}

If all elements of $\lambda_k$ are positive, $\xb_k$ is the optimal solution of QP (Eq. \ref{subqp}). However, if any component of $\lambda_k$ is negative, and the component does not correspond to an equality constraint, then the corresponding element is deleted from the active set and a new iterate is sought.

It is worth to note that, a nonlinearly constrained problem can often be solved in fewer iterations than an unconstrained problem using SQP. One of the reasons for this is that, because of limits on the feasible area, the optimizer can make informed decisions regarding directions of search and step length.

\subsection{Line Search and Merit Function}

The solution to the QP subproblem produces a vector $\db_k$, which is used to form a new iterate
\begin{equation*}
    \xb_{k+1} = \xb_k + \alpha \db_k
\end{equation*}
The step length parameter $\alpha_k$ is determined in order to produce a sufficient decrease in a merit function:
\begin{equation*}
    \Psi(\xb) = f(\xb) + \sum_{i=1}^m \tau_i \cdot g_i(x) + \sum_{j=1}^r \tau_j \cdot \max [0,  h_j(x)]
\end{equation*}
where $\tau_i$ are the penalty parameters.

\subsection{Comparison of Newton's method and SQP }

The advantage of the SQP framework over simply applying Newton's method to the first-order necessary conditions is that the optimization framework gives us some basis for modifying the step when $(\xb_k, \lambda_k, \mu_k)$ is not sufficiently close to $(\xb^*, \lambda^*, \mu^*)$ that pure Newton's method defines a good step. This is the same reason that, in unconstrained minimization, it is advantageous to think of Newton's method as repeatedly minimizing a quadratic model rather than as trying to find a zero of the gradient. Sequential quadratic programming defines a locally convergent algorithm, and it is in this sense that one can talk about the SQP method. However, different techniques can be used to create a globally-convergent iteration, and so there can be many SQP algorithms. 

\section{Experiment and Discussion} 
During simulation, desired grasping positions and the normal directions of the tangential planes are calculated from the forward kinematics which can make sure the problem has solution. For such kind of desired position and orientation, SQP method can always find a solution.
Compared with Interior Point method, SQP method converges more fast.For the given position and orientation, SQP method runs in about thirty iterations while the Interior Point method runs in about two hundreds iterations. \\
 Fig.2 shows that simulations results by using Interior Point method and SQP method. Fig.3 is the convergence process for the SQP method.

\section{Conclusion}
In this project, we solved the inverse kinematics problem for our eight DOF robot system by using nonlinear optimization algorithm. \\
SQP method can always converge to a reasonable destination. Since it does not rely on the inverse of Jacobian matrix, singular points will not effect the solution of it. We also test other nonlinear optimization methods, some of them not convergent and some are quite slow. SQP is stable and fast for solving the inverse kinematics problem for grasping task.  \\
