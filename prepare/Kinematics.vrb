\frametitle{Sequential Quadratic Programming}
A series of algorithms attempt to compute the Lagrange multipliers directly.

Constrained quasi-Newton methods guarantee super-linear convergence by accumulating second-order information regarding the KKT equations using a quasi-Newton updating procedure.

A quadratic programming (QP) problem will be solved at each major iteration.
